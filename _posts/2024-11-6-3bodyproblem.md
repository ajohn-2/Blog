The Chinese science fiction Novel by Liu Cixin and star-hit Netflix show called '3 Body Problem' is based on a theory of the motion of three-point mass particles under their mutual gravitational interactions. This is a classical problem that covers a large range of situations in astrodynamics. 


## Episode 1 - Three Body Problem*

The show opens up taking place in China Cultural Revolution 58 years ago. The first 5 minutes of the show brings suspense as it opens to a protest with a girl named Ye Wenjie, her father, a theoretical physics professor named Ye Zhetai, has been tortured to death for his allegedly anti-Communist beliefs, and her mother, Shao Lin, was among his torturers. Watching as her father gets beaten by military personnel and her own mother for neglecting the policies/laws of physics and teaching his students negative views of the Chinese Government. Seeing the suspense, emotions and intensity of the first 5 minutes, the viewers are able to get a sense of feeling of the character Ye Wenjie and that see also was on the side with her father. Years pass by, Ye Wenjie is recruited by the Chinese Military called the "Red Coast" to conduct "undercover" tests for them, as she is an expert in physics and later will be on the greatest minds to ever lead science, regardless of her political views.These "undercover" tests are known as China being apart of the Space Race along with America and Russia, but instead of getting being the first to get people to space, they wanted to attempt to receive communication with superterrestrial species (Aliens). 

The show move onto the year of 2024, as Particle accelerators around the globe have spent weeks returning results that are either a complete contradiction of 60 years of physics. One of the leading and smartest physics professor Vera Ye(daughter of Ye Wenjie) working at Oxford University. In her final moments, she asks her protege Saul Duran, "Do you believe in God?" before taking her own life by falling into a particle accelerator. This death hits hard for a group of scientists that work at Oxford University because they all looked up to Vera and her work, this even hit harder because of the recent incidents that have occured with physics professors and scientists around the world and the UK. As they celebrated and drank for the life of Vera Ye the group includes Auggie Salazar, a former classmate and lover of Saul Duran, currently developing her own nanofiber project. They are also friends with some of Veraâ€™s former students, including Jin Cheng still doing advanced physics research at the university, Jack Rooney, the rich man and playboy clown of the group, and Will Downing, a very well educated teacher. Auggie experiences herself seeing a very unfamiliar suspenseful countdown in front of her eyes. In distress, Auggie leaves the group and meets a women named Marlo Kelly and
